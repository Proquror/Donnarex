	description = "A fairly old and well-known religious sect on Meralar, the teachings of Tajr-kii Rarkajar (roughly translated as 'We who follow Rarkajar') pervade almost every aspect of modern Selem culture, from sun motifs in paintings to turns of phrase referring to 'the Light'. It is less commonly worshipped among the Siik and Rhemazar, and even more rarely among the Hakar due to their focus on the God Kings, but exceptions exist as with all things. \
  The Tajr-kii hold that Rarjakar and Mephir are locked in eternal battle over the fate of the dead."
